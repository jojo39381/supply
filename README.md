# about

Supply is an iOS application that enables users to donate and request essential items from their local community. Explore our landing page at https://supply-website.vercel.app/

# how it works

#tech stack

We built the **iOS** application using **Swift** and **Xcode**.

For the UI design, we implemented a combination of **UIKit** and **SwithUI** views.

The login authentication is powered by **Firebase**.

The database is implemented in **Firestore** (currently in progress).

The [landing page](https://supply-website.vercel.app/) was made using **React** and is hosted on **Vercel**

Our wireframes and color palette are documented in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
